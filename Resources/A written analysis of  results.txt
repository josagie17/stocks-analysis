The purpose of this analysis is to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. (2017 and 2018)

2) Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script

After comparing stocks performance between 2017 and 2018, it as been determined that the 2017 TERP was lower and in the negatives, living the others in the positive 
 While the 2018 had only 2 that are in the positives which are ENPH at 81.9% and RUN 84.0% leaving the rest in the negatives 
 prior to working on this dataset, when tried to run, it gave an error message with a number '9'

3) Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions

1) What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The Advantages:
     Refactoring Improves the Design of Software
     Refactoring Makes Software Easier to Understand
     Refactoring Helps Finding Bugs
     Refactoring Helps Programming Faster

The Disadvantages:
     you could Run out of money and time.
     It's risky when the application is big, and when the existing code doesn't have proper test cases.
     It's risky when developers do not understand what its all about

2) How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? 

The pros and cons apply to the original script because they could be heavy factors in whether you choose to refactor or not. An example would be, if your code is reliable, refactoring might not be the way to go because you know the original code wonâ€™t break.
